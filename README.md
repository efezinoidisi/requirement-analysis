# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution. It is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes and defines the requirements of the software to be developed.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of defining user expectations for a software. Ultimately, the final goal of a requirement analysis is to develop quality software that meets the users real needs.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Clarity and Understanding**: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.

2. **Basis for Design and Development**: It provides a solid foundation for desigining and developing the system.

3. **Scope Definition**: It clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.

4. **Cost and Time Estimation**: Understanding the scope of a project facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources and time.

5. **Quality Assurance**: It ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

1. **Requirement Gathering**:

   - **Interviews**: Conducting interviews with users to gather detailed iformation about their needs and expectation.

   - **Surveys/Questionnaires**: Distributing surveys to collect requirements from a larger audience.

   - **Workshops**: Organizing workshops with users to discuss and gather requirements.

   - **Observation**: Observing end-users in their working environment to better understand their needs.

   - **Document Analysis**: Review existing documentation and systems to understand current functionalities and requirements.

2. **Requirement Elicitation**:

   - **Brainstorming**: Conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements.

   - **Focus Groups**: Holding focus group discussions with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.

   - **Prototyping**: Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and refine their requirements.

3. **Requirement Documentation**:

   - **Requirement Specification Document**: Creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non-functional requirements.

   - **User Stories**: Writing user stories to describe functionalities from the userâ€™s perspective.

   - **Use Cases**: Creating use case diagrams to show interactions between users and the system.

4. **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**:

   - **Requirement Prioritization**: Prioritizing requirements based on their importance and impact on the project.

   - **Feasibility Analysis**: Assessing the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.

   - **Modeling**: Creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.

5. **Requirement Validation**:

   - **Review and Approval**: Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.

   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.

   - **Traceability**: Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements

These are the requirements that describe what the system should do.

#### Key Functional Requirements for the Booking System

- **User Registration**: New users should be able to create an account with personal details and login credentials.

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration process for users.

- **Search Properties**: Users should be able to search for properties based on various criteria such as location, price and availability.

- **Property Listings**: Users should be able to view properties with essential details and images.

- **Booking System**: Users should be able to book properties, view booking details and manage their bookings.

- **Payment Service**: Users should be able to make payments for their bookings.

### Non-Functional Requirements

These are the requirements that describe how the system should perform.

#### Key Non-functional Requirements for the Booking System

- **Performance**: The system should be able to load pages within 2 secods and handle up to 1000 concurrent users.

- **Security**: Ensure data encryption, secure login and protect against common vulnerabilities.

- **Scalability**: The system should be able to scale horizontally to handle increased traffic.

- **Usability**: The application should have an intuitive UI/UX, making it easy for users to navigate and perform tasks.

- **Reliability**: The system should have an uptime of 99.9% and recover quickly from any failures.

## Use Case Diagrams

Use case diagrams show how different users(actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals.

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

- Provide a clear visual representation of system functionalities.
- Help in identifying and organizing system requirements.
- Facilitate communication among stakeholders and development team.

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria are conditions that a feature must meet to be accepted by the stakeholders.

- Example acceptance criteria for checkout feature of the booking management system: Users should be able to enter billing information and their contact details, confirm booking, select payment method and make payment, receive confirmation after successful payment.

### Why is Acceptance Criteria Important?

- Ensure all parties have a clear understanding of feature requirements.
- Provide a basis for testing and validation.
- Help in maintaining quality and meeting user expectations.
